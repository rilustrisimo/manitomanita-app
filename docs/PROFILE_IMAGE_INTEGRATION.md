# Profile Image Integration Implementation

## Overview
Successfully integrated profile images across the Manito Manita application using Supabase storage with initials fallback functionality. Users can now upload, view, and manage profile images throughout the app.

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes
- **Added `profile_image_url` column** to `user_profiles` table to store Supabase storage paths
- **Created `profile-images` storage bucket** with public read access and user-specific upload/delete policies
- **Applied storage policies** allowing users to manage only their own profile images

### New Components & Utilities

#### ProfileAvatar Component (`src/components/profile-avatar.tsx`)
- Reusable avatar component that handles both profile images and initials fallback
- Uses Supabase storage URLs when available, falls back to DiceBear initials generator
- Supports custom styling and consistent branding

#### Profile Image Utilities (`src/lib/profile-image.ts`)
- `getProfileImageUrl()`: Returns appropriate URL (storage or fallback)
- `getInitials()`: Extracts initials from display names
- `uploadProfileImage()`: Handles file upload to Supabase storage
- `deleteProfileImage()`: Removes images from storage
- `updateUserProfileImage()`: Updates database with new image path

#### Image Processing Utilities (`src/lib/image-processing.ts`)
- `resizeAndCompressImage()`: Resizes images to 100px width with auto-scaling height
- `calculateDimensionsFixedWidth()`: Calculates height based on fixed width and aspect ratio
- `calculateDimensions()`: Legacy function for max width/height constraints (maintained for compatibility)
- `isValidImageFile()`: Validates file types (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
- `formatFileSize()`: Human-readable file size formatting
- Canvas-based processing with high-quality image smoothing

### Updated Components

#### Header Component (`src/components/header.tsx`)
- **Before**: Used mock user data with placeholder avatars
- **After**: 
  - Loads real user profile data from Supabase
  - Uses ProfileAvatar component with real profile images
  - Shows loading state while fetching user data
  - Displays user's screen name and email in dropdown

#### Dashboard Page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Before**: Group members used placeholder pravatar.cc URLs
- **After**: 
  - Fetches profile_image_url from user_profiles table
  - Uses ProfileAvatar for all group member avatars
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing data

#### Profile Page (`src/app/profile/page.tsx`)
- **Before**: Used DiceBear initials generator only
- **After**:
  - Shows current profile image or initials fallback
  - Added image upload functionality with automatic resizing to 100px width
  - Auto-scaling height maintains original aspect ratio (no distortion)
  - Image compression with JPEG format and 80% quality
  - Added image removal capability
  - Integrated with ProfileAvatar component
  - Real-time processing feedback and file size reporting
  - Supports large original files (up to 10MB) that get compressed

#### Settings Page (`src/app/settings/page.tsx`)
- **Before**: Used regular Header component
- **After**: Uses DynamicHeader for consistent auth-aware navigation

#### Group Detail Page (`src/app/groups/[id]/page.tsx`)
- **Before**: Used placeholder avatars for recipient and moderator cards
- **After**: Uses ProfileAvatar with real profile images for all user displays

#### Group Card Component (`src/components/group-card.tsx`)
- **Before**: Used placeholder avatar URLs for member display
- **After**: Uses ProfileAvatar for consistent member avatar display

### Type System Updates

#### Enhanced Member Interface (`src/lib/types.ts`)
- Added `profileImagePath?: string | null` to Member interface
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing `avatarUrl` field
- Updated User interface to include profile image path

### Storage Configuration

#### Supabase Storage Bucket (`profile-images`)
- **Public read access** for displaying images
- **1MB file size limit** for reasonable upload sizes and performance
- **Restricted file types**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- **User-based folder structure**: `{userId}/{filename}`

#### Storage Policies
- Users can only upload images to their own folder
- Users can only delete their own images
- All users can read public profile images
- Automatic folder organization by user ID

### Image Processing Features

#### Automatic Resizing and Compression
- **Target width**: 100px fixed width
- **Auto-scaling height**: Height calculated based on original aspect ratio
- **Aspect ratio preservation**: Images maintain proportions (no distortion)
- **Format standardization**: All images converted to JPEG for optimal compression
- **Quality optimization**: 80% JPEG quality for balance between size and visual quality
- **Canvas-based processing**: High-quality image smoothing for better results

#### File Validation
- **File type checking**: Only allows image files (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
- **Original file size limit**: 10MB maximum for input files
- **Compressed file size limit**: 1MB maximum after processing
- **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages for invalid files

#### Processing Workflow
1. **Upload**: User selects image file
2. **Validation**: Check file type and original size
3. **Processing**: Resize to 100px width with auto-scaling height
4. **Compression**: Convert to JPEG with 80% quality
5. **Validation**: Ensure compressed file meets size requirements
6. **Storage**: Upload processed image to Supabase storage
7. **Cleanup**: Delete old image if replacing existing one

#### Image Management
- **Upload**: Replaces existing image automatically (deletes old image from storage)
- **Delete**: Removes from both storage and database
- **Fallback**: Automatic initials generation when no image exists
- **Optimization**: Automatic cache control headers

### UI/UX Enhancements

#### Consistent Avatar Display
- All profile avatars now use the same ProfileAvatar component
- Consistent fallback behavior across the application
- Branded color scheme (#3ec7c2 background, #1b1b1b text) for initials

#### Upload Interface
- **Upload button** with clear visual feedback showing "Processing..." during compression
- **Remove button** for existing images
- **Loading states** during upload/delete operations
- **Help text** explaining automatic 100px width resizing with auto-scaling height
- **Progress feedback** with compressed file size information

#### Visual Feedback
- Success/error toast notifications for all image operations
- Loading indicators during uploads
- Disabled states to prevent multiple operations

## Migration Files Applied

1. **20250131_add_profile_image.sql**: Added profile_image_url column to user_profiles
2. **20250132_setup_profile_images_storage.sql**: Created storage bucket and policies
3. **20250133_update_profile_images_size_limit.sql**: Updated storage bucket to 1MB file size limit

## Group Creation Enhancements

### Date Validation (`/groups/new`)
- **Future dates only**: Exchange date must be today or in the future
- **Calendar UI**: Past dates are visually disabled in the date picker
- **Form validation**: Server-side validation prevents past dates from being submitted
- **User feedback**: Clear error messages for invalid date selections

## Security Considerations

- Users can only manage their own profile images (enforced by storage policies)
- File type validation prevents non-image uploads
- File size limits prevent abuse
- Proper error handling prevents information disclosure

## Performance Optimizations

- Public storage URLs for fast image delivery
- Automatic cache headers for storage objects
- **Consistent 100px width** for predictable performance and layout
- **Variable height** maintains aspect ratios for different image orientations
- **JPEG compression** reduces file sizes significantly
- **Aspect ratio preservation** ensures quality without distortion
- Optimized image component with proper fallbacks
- Minimal database queries for profile data
- **Canvas-based processing** with hardware acceleration where available

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing users without profile images see initials fallbacks
- Old avatar URL fields maintained for compatibility
- Graceful handling of missing profile image data

## Future Enhancements Ready

- **Different resolution variants** can be easily generated (e.g., 50x50, 200x200)
- **WebP format support** can be added for even better compression
- **Progressive JPEG** encoding for faster loading
- **Background image processing** using Web Workers
- Bulk avatar generation for existing users can be implemented
- **Image quality controls** for user preference settings

## Testing Verified

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Next.js build succeeds
- ✅ Database migrations applied successfully
- ✅ Storage bucket and policies configured
- ✅ All components updated consistently

This implementation provides a complete profile image system that enhances user experience while maintaining the application's design consistency and security standards.
